<h3>About Me</h3>

I'm love to create, so much so that I've become a multigenre creator! I love to make music, program, design, and illustrate, I'll try pretty much anything at least once!

When I create something, there's a small chance that I will never finish it depending on its size, but sometimes I'll complete the task, no matter how monstrous!

I also loooooove to tinker, I build hardware for fun and experiment with what I have, I moved to using linux for majority of my tasks due to developer support!
